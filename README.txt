This project is intended to manage and display flashcards.
If you add cards, the additions are added to copies in case you decide against any cards you added
(I considered having a CheckedListBox display "new cards" in this form, where you could remove them without needing to discard ALL changes)
Removing cards works in the same fashion, only inverse
Reviewing cards shuffles the "terms" list and then displays information based off the index of the shuffled terms
Buttons enable/disable based on if the "pointer" reaches the beginning or end of the list

However, it's not yet in a working state because I can't figure out how to get the class to work.
